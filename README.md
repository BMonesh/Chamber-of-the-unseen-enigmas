## About

Chamber of the Unseen Enigmas is a horror-themed puzzle game where players, as members of a camping expedition, chance upon an enigmatic mansion nestled in the heart of a dense forest. Upon entering, participants find themselves ensnared within the mansion, compelled to navigate through a series of chambers. Within each room, a formidable riddle awaits, accompanied by three doors, each presenting a distinct answer. Only one of these doors opens onto the correct path. Making an incorrect choice twice results in permanent entrapment within the mansion. Successfully deciphering the riddles across five rooms is the key to escaping this eerie abode.
